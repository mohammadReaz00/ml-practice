# Heart Disease Prediction ML Project

## Project Overview

### Objective
The primary objective of this project is to build a robust predictive model for heart disease detection, leveraging machine learning algorithms.

### Algorithms Explored
1. **KNeighbors Classifier:**
   - Utilizes a k-nearest neighbors approach for classification.
   - Examines the proximity of data points to determine the class of the target variable.

2. **Decision Tree Classifier:**
   - Constructs a hierarchical decision tree structure based on features.
   - Makes predictions by traversing the tree from the root to the leaves.

3. **Random Forest Classifier:**
   - Ensemble learning method that constructs multiple decision trees.
   - Aggregates predictions from individual trees to enhance overall accuracy and robustness.
